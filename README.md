# Candidate Management API

A clean and extensible REST API built with **.NET 8**, following **Clean Architecture** and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles. This application is designed to create or update candidate information using a single endpoint and is ready for future scaling and persistence layer replacement.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **.NET 8** â€“ Modern cross-platform backend framework.
- **ASP.NET Core Web API** â€“ RESTful endpoint implementation.
- **Entity Framework Core** â€“ ORM for data access.
- **SQLite** â€“ Lightweight relational database for local development.
- **Clean Architecture** â€“ Separation of concerns, modular structure.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** â€“ Rich domain model (`Candidate` entity).
- **FluentValidation** â€“ Input validation.
- **In-Memory Caching** â€“ Faster repeated access by email.
- **Middleware** â€“ Centralized error handling using `ProblemDetails`.
- **XUnit** â€“ Unit testing framework.
- **Moq** â€“ Mocking dependencies in tests.
- **FluentAssertions** â€“ Clear and expressive test assertions.
- **Swagger / OpenAPI** â€“ API documentation and testing UI.

|------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------|
| Single POST endpoint to create or update candidates  | âœ…     | `POST /api/candidates` |
| Email as unique identifier                           | âœ…     | Lowercased and unique index |

## ðŸ§± Architecture

- **Domain** â€“ `Candidate` entity encapsulates business logic.
- **Application** â€“ DTOs, validators, and interfaces.
- **Infrastructure** â€“ EF Core, SQLite, caching, and repositories.
- **API** â€“ Minimal controller, global exception middleware.
- **Tests** â€“ Unit tests using `XUnit`, `Moq`, and `FluentAssertions`.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Improvements

- Extend caching strategy to use **DistributedCache** for multi-instance deployment.
- Add **async validation** for external URLs.
- Add **Docker Compose** support with PostgreSQL and Seq.
- Add **structured logging** with Serilog and dashboarding via Seq.
- **Integration Tests**.
- Role-based **Authentication**.
- Add **pagination**, **filtering**, and **candidate retrieval endpoints**.

---

## ðŸ¤” Assumptions

- Email is the unique identifier and stored as lowercase.
- Start and end call times are optional but must be valid if provided together.
- Timezones for call times are not considered.
- Phone number is regex-validated but not normalized.
- LinkedIn and GitHub URLs are format-checked only.
- SQLite is used for simplicity, but can be replaced easily via `ICandidateRepository`.
